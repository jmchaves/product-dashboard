# Objective
This app is a project to demonstrate my abilities developing apps.

# Description
Develop a responsive, single-page application (SPA) using a modern JavaScript framework of
your choice (React, Angular) that features a dynamic dashboard. The application should consist
of two main pages: one displaying a sortable table and the other showcasing another form of
data visualization. Additionally, the application will allow users to add new data entries through a
form.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
